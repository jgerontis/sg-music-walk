Will you add support for other cities?
- maybe
Do I really need to use my location?
- yes, otherwise we can't know what music to play
Will you release the music online at some point?
- yes! We're working on that and will update this page accordingly.
Will this app work outside of downtown St. George?
- sort of, it will run and play transitionary music infinitely, but the best experience is definitely in the city itself.
